# Filmorator Personas

---

## Olena (Campaign Owner)

**Who:** Film photography hobbyist. Shoots Portra 400, scans at home. Has 40-80 photos per roll worth considering.

**Context:** Just finished scanning 3 rolls from a trip. Wants to select 20-30 for an album but can't decide. Own judgment feels biased. Asking friends "which do you like?" is tedious and yields vague feedback.

**Goal:** Get an ordered ranking of photos from people whose taste she trusts, without managing a complex tool or begging for responses.

**Constraints:**
- Non-technical. CLI is acceptable but must be simple.
- Limited time. Setup should be minutes, not hours.
- No budget. Free tool or personal hosting.

**Success state:** "I have a top-20 list I'm confident in, and the process was actually kind of fun for everyone."

## Marcus (Engaged Participant)

**Who:** Olena's friend. Enjoys photography, has opinions, willing to help.

**Context:** Receives a link from Olena: "Hey, can you help me rank these photos?" Has 10-15 minutes while commuting.

**Goal:** Help Olena, but also curious how his taste compares to others. Wants to feel his contribution mattered.

**Constraints:**
- Mobile phone. Touch interface.
- Short attention span. If it's tedious, will abandon.
- No signup. Won't create an account for a favor.

**Success state:** "That was quick and kind of interesting. I wonder how the final ranking turns out."

## Daria (Casual Participant)

**Who:** Friend of a friend. Got the link forwarded. Vaguely interested in photography.

**Context:** Saw the link in a group chat. Clicked out of curiosity. Doesn't know Olena personally.

**Goal:** See what this is about. Might contribute a few rankings if it's easy.

**Constraints:**
- Zero commitment. Will bounce instantly if confused.
- No social obligation. Only intrinsic interest.
- Skeptical. "Why should I spend time on this?"

**Success state:** "Oh, that's actually a neat idea. I did a few. Maybe I'll check back for results."

## Anti-Personas (NOT building for)

### Professional Photographer
- Needs client management, invoicing, high volume
- Filmorator is for hobbyists, not pros

### Platform User
- Expects discovery, browsing, public campaigns
- Filmorator is link-sharing, not a platform

### Data Analyst
- Wants export, API, integration
- Filmorator is self-contained, not a data source
